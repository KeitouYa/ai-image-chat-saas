WORKING EXPERIENCE 
Software Engineer (Full Stack) — Yicheng Wuyou Technology, Chengdu                    Jul 2023 – Mar 2025
* Developed client-facing CRM and internal management tools for SMB clients using React, TypeScript and Spring Boot, serving 500+ daily active users.
* Built frontend modules (customer list, sales dashboard, data visualization) with Ant Design; optimized table rendering for 10,000+ row datasets using virtual scrolling, improving LCP from ~3s to <1s.
* Developed RESTful APIs using Spring Boot and MyBatis with input validation, error handling, and RBAC across 20+ endpoints; added Redis caching, reducing API response time from ~500ms to <100ms.
* Implemented frontend error boundaries and Sentry logging; reduced crash rate by ~50% and enabled faster debugging in production.
PROJECT EXPERIENCE
Health Care Plan Generator                                                                     Aug 2025 - Oct 2025
Tech: Python, Django REST Framework, React, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, Redis, Celery, Claude API, OpenAI API, Docker, Terraform, Prometheus, AWS
* Built pharmacy care plan automation platform using Django REST Framework and React/TypeScript, generating clinical documents via LLM to reduce manual documentation workload
* Implemented async task pipeline with Celery/Redis to handle LLM calls (10-30s latency) with failure recovery, reducing API response time to <300ms
* Developed duplicate detection for patient/provider/order records with configurable warning vs blocking rules, preventing data quality issues in PostgreSQL
* Created LLM provider abstraction isolating Claude/OpenAI dependencies, enabling runtime provider switching without code changes or redeployment
* Integrated Prometheus/Grafana monitoring 15+ metrics; containerized 8 services with Docker and Terraform for  AWS deployment (RDS, ElastiCache, ECS)
AI Image Generation & Chat SaaS Platform                                                   Mar 2025 – May 2025        
Tech: TypeScript, Next.js 15, React 19, MongoDB, Redis, Clerk, PayPal | Full-Stack Engineer | Live    
* Developed end-to-end AI chat feature with React chat UI (auto-scroll, loading states) and Node.js backend integrating Gemini/OpenAI APIs with 30s timeout and automatic provider failover
* Built AI image generation flow from React form submission through Replicate API to Cloudinary storage and MongoDB persistence; displayed results in responsive image gallery with lazy loading
* Implemented atomic credit billing using MongoDB findOneAndUpdate with $gte guards; validated with 1,000 concurrent request tests achieving zero over-deduction; synced balance to React Context for real-time UI updates
* Created Redis caching layer (Upstash) achieving 100% cache hit rate; cache hits return in <127ms (P95) vs 1-2s for API calls, reducing per-user costs by ~90%
* Integrated Clerk authentication protecting API routes; built PayPal checkout with 3 pricing tiers and optimistic UI updates for instant feedback
EduNexus — Online Teaching Management Platform                                             Apr 2024 – Aug 2024
Tech: React, TypeScript, Spring Boot, MySQL, AWS S3, Docker | Full-Stack Engineer
* Built scalable React architecture with Zustand for global state and React Query for server-side data fetching, reducing duplicate UI/API logic by ~30% and accelerating feature development cycles.
* Engineered secure authentication system with JWT refresh tokens and role-based authorization across 3 user types, protecting 40+ routes and endpoints.
* Developed RESTful APIs with comprehensive validation and error handling for core features (courses, grading, attendance); integrated AWS S3 with signed URLs for file uploads (up to 50MB) to improve upload reliability.
* Automated deployment using Docker containers and GitHub Actions CI/CD, reducing release time from ~30 minutes to under 5 minutes.
